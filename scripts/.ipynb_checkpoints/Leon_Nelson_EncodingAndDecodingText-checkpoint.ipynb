But the number of ways to encode a character using the ASCII table is very limited. If you clicked on the link, you'll see that there are only 256 character encodings. This means that we would have no way of converting words that are in other languages into *bits*. Many more character encoding systems have be developed based off of the ASCII character encoding system to be able to encode more characters. One of the most common encoding systems is `UTF-8`, which can handle many more characters. \n",

You develop some kind of encoding system where each \"letter\" maps to some number, and you pass this encoding letter to your friend.
